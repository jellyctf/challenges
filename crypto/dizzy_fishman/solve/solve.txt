Diffie Hellman Key Exchange
Use g = p - 1
This will force the constructed shared secret key to be 1 (or p-1), which can be identified from the public keys
Use online AES decryption tool to decrypt (AES256, ECB mode) - e.g. https://the-x.cn/en-US/cryptography/Aes.aspx

Steps in Diffie Hellman Key Exchange are
1. p and g are selected - here we have a choice for g
2. Alice has a private key 'a'; Bob has a private key 'b'
3. Alice's public key is g^a mod p - this is transmitted publicly
4. Bob's public key is g^b mod p   - this is transmitted publicly
5. The shared secret is s = g^(ab) mod p
    > If g = p - 1, then g mod p = (p-1) mod p = -1 mod p
    > Then s = (-1)^(ab) mod p
    > This can only be 1 or (-1) mod p regardless of a and b
    > So, s = 1 mod p, i.e. s = 1 OR s = (-1) mod p, i.e. s = p - 1
    > Try using both keys to decrypt
