Let's see what happens when we paste the oshi mark on Twitter and... oh.

We've exceeded the character limit! But how?

We don't need to paste the oshi mark on Twitter either. 
Opening the file in a text editor like Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Vi, or Nano reveals weird artifacts too.

To see what's going on, go to a Unicode text analyzer (https://www.fontspace.com/unicode/analyzer) and paste the oshi mark.
Notice that the text is comprised of ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER and VARIATION SELECTOR-[1-128].

Make a list of the VARIATION SELECTOR numbers and notice that they're numbered from 1-128. 
[119, 101, 108, 108, 44, 32, 119, ...]

These correspond pretty nicely to ASCII codes. In fact, decoding them yields the following message:
"well, well, well, look who finally decoded my secret oshi mark message! congratulations on wasting countless hours (and probably brain cells) figuring out that "awawawa" means "i love you!" maybe you've finally found a use for all that nerdy knowledge you've accumulated over the years. and let's be honest, you probably couldn't even figure out the message without relying on a silly unicode decoding site you found using hints. don't worry though, i won't tell anyone! how about this? let's give you a prize for your efforts. how about... jellyCTF{a_cut3_alic3_hugg4bl3_plush13}! awawawawawawawa! it's cute how nerdy you are."
