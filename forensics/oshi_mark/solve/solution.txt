It's just two characters, how hard can it be?

Copy-pasting the oshi mark into a search engine reveals an unusually long URL. Paste the oshi mark into a text editor like Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Vi, or Nano and we see some weird artifacts.

To see what's going on, go to a Unicode text analyzer (https://www.fontspace.com/unicode/analyzer) and paste the oshi mark. 
Notice that the text is comprised of ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER and VARIATION SELECTOR-[1-128].

Notice that the VARIATION SELECTOR characters are numbered from 1-128. Let's make a list of the numbers.
[119, 101, 108, 108, 44, 32, 119, ...]

These correspond pretty nicely to ASCII codes. In fact, decoding them yields the following message:
"well, well, well, look who finally decoded my secret oshi mark message! congratulations on wasting countless hours (and probably brain cells) figuring out that "awawawa" means "i love you!" maybe you've finally found a use for all that nerdy knowledge you've accumulated over the years. and let's be honest, you probably couldn't even figure out the message without relying on a silly unicode decoding site you found using hints. don't worry though, i won't tell anyone! how about this? let's give you a prize for your efforts. how about... jellyCTF{a_cut3_alic3_hugg4bl3_plush13}! awawawawawawawa! it's cute how nerdy you are."
