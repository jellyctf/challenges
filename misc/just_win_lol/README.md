looks like that new Balatro game has already got some knockoffs.
the RNG for this one sucks though - how are you ever meant to win?!
note: do not bruteforce, you won't win

hint: the RNG is seeded every request with a well known seed
hint 2: you'll probably want to live off the land and reuse some of the code, it'll make your life easier
explicit hint: precalculate the RNG in the same way as the code to know in advance which cards will win
