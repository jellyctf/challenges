grep for jellyCTF - it's in scenes.json

https://github.com/obsproject/obs-browser/blob/master/README.md#get-scenes

the browser source has `"webpage_control_level": 2`, so we have perms to run it

<script>
window.obsstudio.getScenes(function (scenes) {
    document.querySelector("#message").innerHTML = scenes;
})
</script>
